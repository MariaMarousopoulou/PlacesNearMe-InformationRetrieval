89566	so many good tapas to choose from. didn't even get to the paella. bacon wrapped shrimp was underwhelming but the croquetas were bomb. check in on foursquare for free sangria. (3 of 4 petals via fondu)
12736	paella is delicious, as well as the sangria!!!
50489	this is where andrew carmellini got his start. the food is still sublime although it is little on the fancy side. (3 of 4 petals via fondu)

17574	vegetarians should steer clear of this place. great service and rad place but unless you want salad or omlette head elsewhere.

1826	glad they finally got rid of the paper straws for their bloody mary.
34281	large bloody mary. then any of the food, cause its all amazing!
64130	salads are for sharing. love the venetian cocktail. it's mistake not to order mushrooms. scallops are unreal, and the gritty texture you taste isn't sand; it's salt.
196154	the hen of the woods mushrooms: intense flavor. striped bass: perfectly cooked. the beet salad was also noteworthy. for dessert, try the tangerine buttermilk sorbet. delish!

163156	miso broth is way too salty leaving my ramen experience quite disappointing... stick to the veg dumpling soup or watch out for the salty miso didnt enjoy that!
163156	green tea mousse and sweet potato pudding ... the veggie dumpling soup is great and very filling for $6!
210809	the tori (chicken) nanban-don is pretty good.

211167	what used to be my favorite pizza place on nyc is now serves mostly over priced day-old slices which they overcook so you won't notice how long they've been sitting out. order fresh pizza instead

79500	fantastic food and service. highly recommend for authentic italian experience in little italy!

75042	the service is not good, the place needs food makeover asap.....horrible food presentation...disappointed.
55428	don't be fooled by it's location or it's look, it truly is nothing more than pricey late night diner with nice view.

196154	i love this quaint tapas bar, and the menu is authentic. the brandada is delicious, the clams are also excellent. always crowded and they don't take reservations.
8952	love the calamari po-boy sandwich. so tender
195669	love this place -- great food \/ ambiance and very very affordable. though, it gets very loud \/ crowded on the weekends after 9pm, so i'd go early if you want to chat without losing your voice!
52312	nowhere else can you eat this cheap and this good the kang gai is heaven.
54488	fried calamai is great!! well seasoned and great with plum sauce!

34460	this place is byob. so i think the food is good here and worth the money, but keep in mind that this place is byob. and i writing this review while i'm still here. byob. (4 of 4 petals via fondu)
26055	my friend calls this food
26055	honestly, this place sucks. if you like indian food you won't recognize what you're served here.
52284	the butter chicken is amazing here. make sure to go to the downstairs restaurant
98138	i wonder what the utility bill looks like for all those lights. you want to go to the restaurant on the top right. there appears to be 3 others that look the same. we got to celebrate bday! oh man.
943	the desserts here are ridiculously good, even though they have no meat in them.
82569	winner of best patio dining in the village voice 2011 best of issue! the back garden and surprisingly delicious raw food make it an urban oasis.
55222	one day, when i very rich woman, i will hire the chef to be my personal meal maker, and achieve my dream of becoming an unwavering vegetarian.
24438	if you need\/want raw this is the premier place for it
78275	if you want to try flavors you've probably never tasted before, try the pear ravioli or lemon pasta, both incredibly tart (if that's your thing). desserts are home run in new kind of ballpark.
78275	slap your tastebuds into shape with the raw and vegan offerings. safer things on the menu (if this is your first raw experience) are the lasagna and tamales.
3744	try the raw lasagne (via @foodspotting)
7599	spanking and goji high smoothies are awesome.
196154	i love the menu here, and the patio is perfect!
11075	here's the trick to sitting outside: call to make reservation. they won't give you seat as walk-in. also green apple juice raw lasagna is sooo good.
11075	zucchini lasagna + malbec + salted chocolate caramel tart = yum! plus, they have ferreira port.
54073	sit outside and order one of everything. lasagna. burger. taco salad. shakes. everything is good here!
43127	this place is very expensive and all you get are few vegetables. not worth it imo.

23442	any arepa with avocado. and don't forget to drink michelada!
7378	the tequeños are like the platonic ideal of fried cheese stick.
231211	lunch special for 8.50 on weekday is an arepa+soup\/salad, to stay or go. awesome and delicious.
6243	a15 and michelada make great combo.
42683	get the cuban sandwich. wow!
2442	if you go, sit outside. it felt so dirty inside. the food was pretty blah, so i'd say go somewhere else.
1317	this place is the best in the summer. sit outside, drink margaritas beer eat inauthentic (but good) mexican food to your heart's content.
4373	try the
102	they microwaved the enchiladas.
175163	one of few restaurants still open past 9:30pm. wtf? anyway, nice server, pretty good food. try the beans and rice with carnitas. yum.
5503	beware:the fish tacos are really salty.
25438	if you're ballsy enough, try the bull penis.
39279	get the lightly seared fatty tuna!
59479	if you don't eat, there is 8 dollar per person minimum. pitcher of ichiban costs 8 dollars. the food doesn't. the menus have gross anime porn on them.

17574	spicy pumpkin cupcake is so good. but the best surprise are the puddings! chocolate chip banana puddings give the cupcakes are run for their money!
195601	don't miss the pudding in the back! chocolate chip cookie dough and cream pudding... i'd die!
34460	this is where i go to get my sugar fix during afternoons at work. cupcakes are solid, cheesecakes are so rich (4 of 4 petals via fondu)
27404	you have made wonderful decision. pistachio for sure. sassy>sexy red velvet.
208452	spicy pumpkin. just do it. there's no better option, i promise you.
20711	peanut butter buttercream. that is all.
6360	raspberry lemon trifle was transporting. cake in cup nowhere near as good.
953	my fav cafe in all nyc. great working environment, friendly, crowd changes throughout day into night
17476	skip this place. make an iced coffee and hang out in your apartment. it's cheaper, there are probably less screaming children, and your bathroom is probably cleaner.
34131	diverse crowd. comfortable. good variety of food and drinks. always something new going on. you'll feel at home.
49714	prices are cheap but can do without the live band
225025	the best guacomole ever!

19732	doing the omakase. it's really the only way.
196154	get the omakase, period. the crepe mille feuille for dessert is good too!
193062	the omakase was terrific, 22 pieces of sushi in all, with foie gras that just melts in your mouth in between, the only thing is that some of the pieces were just different versions of the same fish.

22719	best mac and cheese ever! if you don't believe that you can make meal out of gourmet mac and cheese, you need to check this place out

242207	jenny is awesome love coming by to chat with her
27404	one of manhattan's best coffee spots in such weird, nondescript locale. they have pourovers here, but more important to me is the cold-brew. hard to find as good cup of iced coffee.
23014	really, no fresh fruit?
237695	always eat here when i'm doing laundry. turkey burgers are the best.
237695	awesome cherry cokes. they use super sweet grenadine.

16255	great at 1pm when all other east village spots have long lines
193653	got here in the first day they offered breakfast burrito! score
92202	loud. loud. loud. if you want to have overpriced mexican in the most obnoxiously loud venue in the area, this is for you.

42283	the linguini w\/ peas, spring onion garlic..amazing. fresh light with kick of chilli, so good.
13999	brunch gets crowded quickly but if you're only you might try bar seat.
16602	enjoy sixpoint bengali tiger ipa. rare find and fantastic beer.
5009	my favorite: make your partner order the pancakes (delicious), and you order the hash (best i've had). split and enjoy.

82455	hard to have bad meal here--but the banana bread pudding is must--even if you don't have room.
37210	check out the chicken waffles! you won't be sorry....
14324	try: sweet potato and goat cheese croquettes, duck meatloaf and their dark and stormy. you will not regret. go to mini bar for drink if there is long wait for table; they'll call you when ready.

14046	kick ass screwdrivers and blood orange mimosas!
21380	stopped in long enough to hang with my bud, decor is nice, can't speak to the food, i would be down to check it out again.
22595	sour berry cocktail is the way to go. muddled berries... yum.
8466	expect wait until about 10pm, but if you wait, definitely get the soup dumplings

68155	soup dumplings
5503	friday lunges here get you through the rest of the week! order some onion rings.

2839	chocolate peanut butter shake is very tasty, but not tasty enough for 15 minute wait at that price (~$7.50)
73518	this starbucks is one of my favorites...
12215	try the cupcakes peanut butter cupcake. i heart starbucks. (via @foodspotting)
178972	drink coffee and destroy.

58	they've currently got deal running where you can get three course dinner (app, entre, dessert) for 19 bucks sunday through thursday.
1296	the truffle grilled cheese may have been inspired by lascivious chuck bass scene in gossip girl, but it really is that good. enjoy with sidecar or glass of red wine.
8388	impressive, ornate, and romantic place to start or end midtown nyc evening
8388	sadly gilt is closed for the summer come back in the fall!

27769	love the carne asada. the wait is long...but worth it.
13501	40 minutes and waiting. not good for short lunch break

38305	the choco frosting with toasted coconut cupcake is the best

11206	bbq chicken pizza is great!

76327	go here.. it's goood.
40642	good ramen. but little on the pricey side.

6318	if you are looking to camp out and get some work done, keep walking! they covered most if not all of the outlets!
11527	the lines grow and shrink based on when the inter-city busses are picking up. there's not much you can do but come early and hope you catch break. the upstairs is nice for waiting on bus though.

195207	don't be fooled. you might want to order 10 of these little burgers but 3-4 is all i can eat. they must be the best in the whole state.
51468	double cheese with onions and pickles is the way to go! no lettuce or tomatoes allowed!

1193	great for delivery but you must at least once go there in person for good karma. go on busy night and you will be entertained..
104	the kobe burger is outstanding. 1\/4 pound should do unless you're totally starving. ps: mixed fries are the way to go.
19335	the sliders are perfect if you don't want to walk away in burger coma. the fries are on point too and should not be skipped. regular or sweet potato.

130957	eric rules! get the patron+ the marimba!
6853	i agree that the place is sub par and pricy, but i also add slow to that. if you want good mexican\/texmex go to lobo blocks down on sacket.

16498	bird's nest is delicious.
52025	the best breakfast in the area, can't go wrong ;-)
616	you can't go wrong with the sample platter, but go for the meat potato dumplings too. maybe order an extra side of kielbasa.
22575	don't order the vegetable soup its just potato in cup
29949	best chicken noodle soup on the island. overall better eats than gentrified veselka up the street.
4463	wow bad service and poor food. stay away.
17141	great sandwich menu.
40736	amazing sandwiches with fresh italian meats and homemade mozzarella for only $7!
29123	um, grilled cheese sandwiches should not be open-faced. or have lettuce. also, tuna melts should be melted. also, boneless buffalo wings should have buffalo sauce on them.
109481	if you order the french dip, get extra jus... they give you tiny cup of it.
27367	carbonara is made right.wud add more pepper,but not alfredo sauce.egg,cheese,pasta water.fried mozz is 3 stix w sauce not the mozzarella in carrozza waiter said it wud be. (2 of 4 petals via fondu)
114319	try the food some great options and recent additions like dulce de leche treats are great cozy neighborhood coffee shop!
82569	they brought sausage (christian style), vareniki with sour cherries, vareniki with potato, baked eggplant saute
237070	i would skip this one great atmosphere but very mediocre food. not what you'd expect in little italy.
38456	the pizza is so industrial. starting with the crust (which isnt crispy at all), continuing with the sauce (tastes like it was taken from can at the grocery store) and finish with mediocre cheese.
13999	order via app or online to beat the long lunch lines and go straight to the register to pick up your order.
25094	i love chipotle. this one is as good as the others but pretty busy\/long lines with lots of tourists (no surprise given the location). (3 of 4 petals via fondu)

21442	if you're getting food here, go for the tacos or the bowls. their rice and beans are nothing special, so the best strategy is to load up on sour cream and meat.
27404	this place is always too busy. you should be getting creative anyway and trying out the koreatown digs on 32nd st. or at least nommy heartland brewery next door (with more time, of course.)
59619	ask for punch card if u don't already have one! great cafe latte.
23420	i had the most sublime cafe latte here. may be the best i've had in nyc.

49206	take your coffee into the lounge! it's amazing.
10760	probably the best coffee in new york keep on going back there. the hipster outfits are bit of turnoff tho portland one takes itself little less seriously.
82569	winner of best new coffeehouse in the village voice 2011 best of issue! grab yourself one of their bottled iced coffees and plant yourself in the hotel lobby.
36073	their hipster-barista uniforms are as embarrassing as the coffee is delicious!
16654	the coffee is worth the wait. the mocha kicks ass.
49206	the caramelized french toast. can't go wrong with any choice here. make sure to go to the lobby to find place to sit. tons of chairs and couches. free wifi code at the front desk.
16602	buy bag of stumptown beans and get complimentary cup of coffee!
1090	an opium den for hipster coffee addicts.
63433	ask what's on the secret podge menu. if they ask where you found that, deny deny deny 4square.
199027	wifi blows
27404	this place always has line for reason: the people of portland know what they're doing with their beans. come at slower time and enjoy your java in the ace hotel lobby with good book.
49206	get coffee and relax.
5009	they pull two shots for all sizes, so keep to the small latte unless you want to order extra shots in the medium or large!
65514	blueberry creame cookie. it is like eating cookie dough! amazing
78275	charming staff and the cappuccino is little drop of heaven, (emphasis on 'little', cup is mini size)!

21380	be sure to try the cookies, hands down the best in the biz and also try one of their delicious crepe sanwich
21380	best place to get coffee in the area and the two lovely ladies tending service are always pleasure to chat with, this talk of devon whatever sounds like some paid sponsorship...

26729	no mention of the fish tacos??? frigging awesome. and you are what you eat, which is why i'm awesome.
68798	the mild guacamole is just that good, but very mild. however, the medium guac practically burned my mouth off! my advice: get the mild with side of jalepenos so you can adjust the spice yourself.
63386	cucumber margarita rocks! yummy tacos! finally decent place on ues!

26202	the don't take american express, unfortunate.
28925	best frozen yogurt spot in nyc hands down. pinkberry is so overrated.

31943	it's all about the danish cheese. that is all.
9566	the coconut mini baklava is to die... but you have to be stern when you are ordering. the staff isn't really the nicest but after while they get to know you.

107963	sit at the bar at lunch and have the burger with cheese and thick chunks of bacon on top.

1664	get the smoky the burrito it's always fabulous!
76657	make your own quesadilla- chili cheese green peppers and guac. ¡que rico!
78275	delicious smoothies, great late night spot.
175163	double check your order. they gave me reg coke instead of diet. they gave me honey mustard dressing instead of ranch. other than that, the food was really good.
15272	there is some magical ingredient in their rigatoni bolognese that makes it the best in the city!!!
63524	if you like your wings on the crispy side, texas does it right
48682	come for lunch and get the reasonably priced chopped steak.
240799	don't even bother going in for lunch without ordering and expect to be out soon enough to go back to your office to actually sit down and enjoy it---call in and order ahead

17982	ice coffee is more expensive then other dunkin' donuts

69788	best bar in the neighborhood!
243427	great wings
43734	isa adrianna are da bomb. best waitresses in the city.
43734	apparently not all atomic wings are created equal. midtown 1140 second av is horrible. nothing at all like the fantastic blue room.
43734	...and don't forget the combo waffle fries and onion rings. you would be hard pressed to find any better.
43734	best damn wings...anywhere!

8051	it's ok to ask for more parmesan cheese. drink the sangria.
72	for some reason, i always get the chicken and gyro combo platter. it's like breakfast, lunch and snacktime all in one and you cannot resist
254822	def go on live music nights and ask for john's section- he's the best! have the black eyed pea soup and save room for the bread pudding!
29301	daft punk goes surprisingly well with tacos and sangria. definitely try the pomegranate skirt steak tacos!!
193062	got the mahi mahi tacos, pretty decent but pretty small, not truly worth the 10 bucks.

17228	this place is ghetto fab
2308	always eat before the yankee game
38363	blueberry scones are delish.
131875	it's heavy and juicy but still yummy
14203	i recommend cheeseburger with raw onions. you can skip the fries; they're nothing to write home about.
150051	the tomato soup is really good, but i would only order small, or it becomes too much. getting your sandwich toasted might take an extra 10 minutes, but it's better that way.
173942	ask for the chef's table
24873	try the apple crumble la mode third course...nom nom nom (via @foodspotting)
24873	try the salmon second course...nom. (via @foodspotting)

119217	nyc classic! everyone should experience le cirque at least once!
21380	friendly and nice, try the portobella mushroom salad and the turkish tea

36202	hot sandwiches are decent but overpriced. generally overpriced, bad quality food

43388	good pan-asian. great quality to price ratio. decor is awesome.
